# Mini-Project-To-Do-List-Application
Command Line Interface To-Do List App
This app is a To-Do List app that runs on the command line. 
The program will start by offering the user 5 different options. 
The program offers the opportunity to add a task, view tasks, mark a task as complete, delete a task, and quit the program.
If the user chooses the first input they can then add a task to the "tasks" list while also adding the "incomplete" label indicating it is a new task that has not been worked on.
The second input will allow the user to view all tasks both incomplete and completed.
The third input allows the user to take a task under the "tasks" add it to the "completed_tasks" list while also removing the "incomplete" task and replacing it with a tag that reads "complete."
The fourth input allows any task from the "tasks" list to be deleted.
Finally, the last input ends the program.
